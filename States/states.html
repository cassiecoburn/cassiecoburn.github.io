<p>Analysis of State Websites</P>
<h1>My Favorite Website: <a href="http://nebraska.gov" target="_new" title="Nebraska Website">Nebraska</a></h1>
<img src="nebraska.png">
<p>My favorite state website was Nebraska because the home page is immediately eye-catching. The home page is very user friendly, the website is compatible with iPhones. I am a huge fan of the large buttons that easily and very clearly direct you to the pages you want to go. Their home page picture is high quality and the grey color scheme looks really nice as a border. Nebraska has large and clear font which makes it very easy to read.</p>
<p>I really didn't find anything I didn't like about Nebraska's website. They have links to all of their social medias, and inviting color scheme with clear graphs. Their website is designed very efficiently so I feel if I needed to find something quick I could. Any link they go to, includes text that if you had a disability it would help you click what you want. </p>
<h2>My Second Favorite Website: <a href="http://alaska.gov" target="_new" title="Alaska Website">Alaska</a></h2>
<img src="alaska.jpg">
<p>Alaska's website has a great color scheme that fits well with their flag. They identify their indigenous people with the language as one of the first items you see. I liked the fact that you could "check the status" of the flag which is a neat feature. I think their font could be bigger, it is a little small in some areas and they don't have the option to see what you are clicking on for those with disabilities. </p>
<p>Alaska's website is compatible with phones. The home page guides users easily to some quick click options including: Residents, Business, Visitor which could get someone where they need to go. Alaska has some repetitive information on the home page which might be fillers. I think they could have used those spaces wiser with differnt links or increasing the font size to fill up space. They put a section on 'popular links' at the bottom which might be more useful towards the top of the webpage. </p>
<h3>My Third Favorite Website: <a href="http://az.gov" target="_new" title="Arizona Website">Arizona</a></h3>
<img src="arizona.png"> 
<p>Arizona's home page is really pleasing to the eye. They did a really nice job utilizing different photos and filling the whole page with color. I hate looking at white space, so this was a really nice change when comparing it to Montana's or New Hampshire's websites. I did notice that when you make the screen smaller to see how compatible it is with smaller screens, the graphics completely go away. If I was on my phone, this website probably wouldn't be as appealing.</p>
<p>The information in the website itself, including the tabs are somewhat vague. I think they could have added more. The top bottoms aren't that calibrated when you scross your mouse over them, it doesn't scroll over the correct titles with the correct name. For example, today is September 11 and the 'flag status' says they are at full staff but today they are at half. Might just be an updating issue.</p>
<h4>My Fourth Favorite Website: <a href="http://mt.gov" target="_new" title="Montana Website">Montana</a></h4>
<img src="montana.png"> 
<p>Montana's website is okay. I wanted to like it more but the white space is a little boring and we have so many scenic photos that I think they could have colored up the design with more photos and history of Montana. I wasn't a huge fan of the graphics they used. For example, the link to the 'medicine cabinet' is a cartoon of a medicine bottle. I'm not sure that was the best they could come up with.</p>
<p>Overall, the website is very boring. It has a lot of open, white space, small font, and vague titles. I think they could have done a lot more. The 'About Montana' information is just a list and has no graphics or eye-catching items. Not a fan, but I love Montana. </p>
<h5>My Least Favorite Website: <a href="http://nh.gov" target="_new" title="New Hampshire Website">New Hampshire</a></h5>
<img src="nh.jpg"><img src="nhsucks.jpg">
<p>To put it frankly, New Hampshire's website sucks. The pictures are very dry, the information is boring and 'listy'. The website looks very similar to this website analysis html if I were to say this looks like a completed website. They have links to pages with no border, padding, picture, or even a simple background color. I'm not sure why they chose to list decades of election results as one of the most prominent things on their website but it is not information the general public will be searching for often. </p>
