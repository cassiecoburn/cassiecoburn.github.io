<p> Here is information on my research of Webhost sites.</p>
<h1>My first webhost is <a href="http://godaddy.com" target="_new" title="GoDaddy Website">GoDaddy</a></h1>
	<p> 
	Go Daddy is user-friendly, cheap to use and has a variety of different templates.</p>
	<p>It starts out at as little as $3.66/month with the ability to easily upgrade if you want.</p>
	<p>Go Daddy's speed is fast and their customer service is available 24/7. </p>
	
<h2>My second webhost is <a href="http://fatcow.com" target="_new" title="Fatcow Website">Fatcow</a></h2>
<p> Fatcow's website design is nice for first time users because they offer a free domain name, unlimited space, bandwidth, emails, and databases.
<p> Fatcow offers a unique feature that could be something users choose, is that it is powered 100% by wind energy.</p>
<h3>My third webhost is <a href="http://wix.com" target="_new" title="Wix Website">Wix</a></h3>
<p> Wix would be a preferable webhost to use because of its' user-friendliness. Wix utilizes a simple drag and drop method which makes it ideal for all users.</p>
<p> Wix starts out at $4.08/month. The option to upgrade is available on one of their premium plans which lets you have your own domain name, remove ads, and offers a wider variety of templates.</p>
<h3>Go Daddy</h3>
<p> I chose Go Daddy because it is a well-known site with good quality customer service. I also think it will be the most user-friendly for what I am trying to do.</p>
<p>I think if I were designing a  more intricate website I might choose someting with better features but for the fact I am a beginner and just starting up, Go Daddy will be the webhost provider for me.</p>
