<p> Here is information on my research of two websites that I thought were well-designed, and one that was not.</p>
<h1>My first website is <a href="http://rfcx.org" target="_new" title="Rainforest Website">Rainforest Connection</a></h1>

	<p>Rainforest Connection is my favorite website that I have found. The home page is the most eye-catching. It has a high definition
		picture of the rainforest along with an actual playback of the rainforest. I thought that was a great
		feature they added. The website did use HTML5 elements. I thought it looked modern and was easy to use.</p>
		
	<p>When going through the different webpages of the site, I noticed there was a scrolling effect as well as 
		table formatting. Rainforest Connection has a consistent theme throughout all their pages that make them 
		cohesive. The website is compatible with phone screens and the code is clean and organized. I noticed that for their font size, they used
		a percentage. I didn't realize you could do that, so that surprised me. All the links to their different pages offer a small tidbit on what it is 
		about so you can decide if you want to 'learn more'. I like this because it keeps the website from being too wordy.</p>
		
	<p>Rainforest Connection uses a lot of green shades and white. This enhances the clarity and clean feel of the website's purpose. Pictures are all evenly spaced and 
		relevant to the content. Some of the little details that I appreciated were the loading page when you first go to the site. It is their logo of a leaf in the middle of the screen.
		the rainforest sound that you can play was a nice touch that makes the website more interactive for the audience. The tone they used was modern and had a voice to it, unlike really formal words 
		that aren't easily understood.</p>
	
<h1>My second website is<a href="https://us.camposcoffee.com/" target="_new" title="Campos Coffee Website"> Campos Coffee</a></h1>
	<p>Campos Coffee's website is very appealing. There is a lot of white space that pairs well with the photos they chose. Their logo and motto is really cute. The loading screen shows their logo which is
		a typical art design that you make with milk and foam when pouring over espresso. When I think of coffee, I think of comfort and cozy spaces. This website gives me that feel. It is easy to use, has interesting content including 
		their blog with fun and interesting articles. They used green, off-white, and browns. All neutral colors that go well with the idea of 'organic' and coffee.</p>
		
	<p>As far as their website layout goes, I like their font and all their spacing seems really even all around. Their header, body, and footer blended into each other well.
		In my opinion, what makes their website so appealing is how decluttered, simple, and straightfoward it is. Simplicity is a key theme in the best websites that I researched. They have drop down menus for all of their
		page tabs which makes the website as a whole really easy to navigate. /p>

<h1>My third and the worst website is <a href="https://jamilin.com/" target="_new" title="Jamilin Website">Jamilin</a></h1>
	<p>Jamilin is horrible. To start off, they have absolutely no color theme. There are random header tabs, the colors are ridiculous and have no theme whatsoever.
		They used different fonts throughout the page. They capitalized random letters for no reason. I have no idea where I would even start to look for something. They honestly use way too many links. The font size is too large
		in some parts whereas way too small in others. I have been looking at this website now for about twenty minutes and still don't really understand the purpose of it.</p>
		
	<p>When I looked at the coding of the website, if it says anything at all, the main color is called "internal root". I'm sure it is no surprise that it is not compatible with smaller screens. Surprisingly, it does contain table elements.
		There is no form of uniform margins or padding. The color meshes everything together and the random font colors are not helping it any. Honestly, I have just figured out this is a Feng Shui website. I looked up the definition and got
		"A system of laws considered to govern spatial arrangement and orientation in relation to the flow of energy"...There is absolutely no Feng Shui to this website design. </p>
